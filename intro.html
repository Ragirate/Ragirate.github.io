<p style="text-align:justify"> What is Netiquette? Simply stated, it's network etiquette -- that is, the etiquette of cyberspace. <br>And "etiquette" means "the forms required by good breeding or prescribed by authority to<br> be required in social or official life." In other words, Netiquette is a set of rules for behaving properly online.<br><br>

When you enter any new culture -- and cyberspace has its own culture -- you're liable to commit a few social blunders.<br> You might offend people without meaning to. Or you might misunderstand what others say and take offense when it's not<br> intended. To make matters worse, something about cyberspace makes it easy to forget that you're interacting with other <br>real people -- not just ASCII characters on a screen, but live human characters.<br><br>

So, partly as a result of forgetting that people online are still real, and partly because they don't know the conventions, <br>well-meaning cybernauts, especially new ones, make all kinds of mistakes.<br><br>

The book Netiquette has a dual purpose: to help net newbies minimize their mistakes, and to help experienced<br> cyberspace travelers help the newbies. The premise of the book is that most people would rather make friends<br> than enemies, and that if you follow a few basic rules, you're less likely to make the kind of mistakes that will<br> prevent you from making friends.<br><br>

The list of core rules below, and the explanations that follow, are excerpted from the book. They are offered here<br> as a set of general guidelines for cyberspace behavior. They won't answer all your Netiquette questions. But they<br> should give you some basic principles to use in solving your own Netiquette dilemmas.</p>
